# Fridge Management System

The Fridge Management System is a comprehensive web-based application designed to streamline the operations of a beverage manufacturer that provides fridges to its customers. This system aims to replace the current manual processes and paper-based documentation with a more efficient and technologically advanced solution.

## Features

1. **Administration Subsystem**: Manages physical locations, customers, fridges, suppliers, and various employees, including Customer Liaisons, Inventory Liaisons, Service Technicians, and Purchasing Managers. It also handles the checks required for servicing fridges.

2. **Customer Management Subsystem**: Enables Customer Liaisons to manage customer data, create and manage fridge allocations to customers, and facilitate seamless distribution and monitoring of fridges. Inventory Liaisons can manage fridge inventory, adjust stock levels based on new deliveries or scrapped fridges, and generate purchase requests when inventory levels are low.

3. **Fridge Fault Subsystem**: Allows customers to report faults and track their status, as well as request new fridges. Fault Technicians can view a comprehensive list of reported faults, prioritize them, process fault reports, diagnose issues, and schedule repairs with customers.

4. **Fridge Maintenance Subsystem**: Enables Maintenance Technicians to view customer fridges, maintenance and service history, schedule maintenance visits, service fridges, and create fault reports if needed. Customers can view upcoming maintenance visits and access detailed fridge history, including maintenance and service records.

5. **Purchasing Subsystem** (optional): Streamlines procurement operations by allowing the Purchasing Manager to manage suppliers, view and process purchase requests from the Inventory Liaison, create requests for quotations (RFQs) to suppliers, process received quotations, and create purchase orders. Suppliers can create delivery notes when orders are ready for delivery.
